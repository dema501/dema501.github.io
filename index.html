<p>Hi! Welcome to my website.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a Back-end developer, plain and simple. I work with javascript (nodejs), Golang and Python</p>

<p>I love to learn rare programming languages just to understand idea behind and key features.</p>

<p>I also have experience doing Front-end work but it's not kind of job I like most.</p>

<p>Here is my own area and don’t represent my employer’s positions, strategies or opinions.</p>
